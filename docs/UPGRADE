I. Upgrade
_____________________________________

    A. Upgrade from ACID
    _________________________________
    
    To upgrade from an install of ACID, all that you need to do is copy the
    relevant settings into base_conf.php.  These would be the location of
    ADODB, along with all of the database configuration information.
    
    You can also run the setup program by accessing {URL to base}/setup/
    e.g. http://127.0.0.1/base/setup/
    
    B. Upgrade from 1.x version of BASE
    _________________________________

    To upgrade from a previous version of BASE, you will need to copy the
    configuration from your current base_conf.php to the example on provided
    as base_conf.php.dist.  This is because of various changes needed for bug
    fixes.
    
    C. Upgrade from a previous version of BASE prior to 1.0
    _________________________________
    
    To upgrade from a previous version of BASE, you will need to copy the
    configuration from your current base_conf.php to the example on provided
    as base_conf.php.dist.  This is because of changes needed for the language
    support.
    
    If you are running MYSQL, you will also need to execute the
    upgrade_0.9.x_to_1.0-mysql.sql file to fix an issue with the field size
    of the usr_passwd field.
