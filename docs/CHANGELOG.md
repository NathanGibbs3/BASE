## [1.4.5 (lilias)] - 2009-11-03
### Added
- Default Sort Order.  
Now "time_d" (= descending order) instead on "none".  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/234/)
on sourceforge.net by Brian. Original ID: 2899177  
- Added some debug code to take on bug #2880551  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/228/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2880551

Contributor(s): Juergen Leising
### Changed
- Snort,org SID lookup.  
Now matches new functionality in the snort.org web site.
Such a lookup needs a URL, such as http://www.snort.org/search/sid/1-2003 .  
Contributor(s):
  - Shawn Jefferson from the "Snort-users" mailing list on Feb, 23rd 2010.
  - Juergen Leising
  - [Kevin Johnson]
- Contrib code base-rss.  
Contributor(s): Dan Michitsch
### Fixed
- Display of archived Alerts.  
While the alerts have been archived correctly, any lookups of them in the 
archive DB have failed, because connecting to the archive DB was 
performed using the `baseConnect()` method only, and several sql queries in 
`base_qry_alert()` are simply not compatible with `baseConnect()`. Using 
`basePConnect()` fixes this. **Actually, more a workaround than a real fix.**  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=7609952)
on sourceforge.net.   
- Changing packet display type shows error message Temporary fix.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/226/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2874199
- Fixed pcap download for FLoP-extended DB's on 64-bit platforms.  
- Fixed Fatal error: Call to undefined method.  
"Call to undefined method `ProtocolFieldCriteria::ProtocolFieldCriteria()` in
includes/base_state_citems.inc.php"  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/235/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2919599
- Insufficient memory for the world map functions in base_graph_main.php.  
Increased it to 256MB.
- Labelling of the x-axis with the signature classifications chart.
- The font system in the PEAR::Image::Graph and Canvas library is broken on
fedora 12 with php-5.3.  
This can not be fixed from inside BASE, any more.
However, a fix is possible, if the IMAGE_CANVAS_SYSTEM_FONT_PATH
in /usr/share/pear/Image/Canvas.php from the PEAR::Image::Canvas library gets
defined properly. The fontmap.txt file does NOT matter, any more.  
See docs/README.graph_alert_data for details.

Contributor(s): Juergen Leising
- IP address encoding problem in base_payload.php:  
This refers to non-flop DB's only.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/233/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2889623.  
Contributor(s): Brian Brzezicki & Brad Benson Discovery & patch.

## [1.4.4 (dawn)] - 2009-07-24
### Changed

Rewrote code that produces a link to a local directory with documentation for
alerts in front of the signature names.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/216/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2808527  
Contributor(s):

on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2798983  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/221/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2828709
- Signature display error.  
Signature names were displayed as raw html rather than as real names with
clickable URLs.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/213/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2803137

## [1.4.2 (chandy)] - 2009-04-03
### Added
- A new reference "[rule]" now points to base_local_rules.php, which displays

well.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/bugs/207/)
on sourceforge.net. Original ID: 2234733
- Loss of Sort Order when action applied to alerts.

so far, are now processed and displayed by BASE. This affects all those
preprocessors which have sig names that do NOT start with an "spp_" prefix.

Contributor(s):
  - Michel Lundell.

- Workaround for a potential bug in `preg_replace()`.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/discussion/404428/thread/de160eca/)
on sourceforge.net.  
- Missing signature classification names issue in base_graph_common.php.  
In this case different bars should be displayed, not just one "unclassified"
one.
- Misc HTML bugs in the query form.
- Syntax error in setup1.php in case of a wrong adodb path.
- Sensor display issue in search form.
Same problem as in `UpdateAlertCache()` in base-php4/includes/base_cache.inc.php.
- SQL error with sig_priority when queried from the query form.
- "Select Signature from List" issue in the query form.
- Bug #2001211.

Contributor(s): Juergen Leising
- Insufficient memory for the world map functions in base_graph_common.php.  
Increased it from 50MB to 128MB.  
Bug [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/secureideas/discussion/404428/thread/330426b5/)
on sourceforge.net.  
Contributor(s):
  - Chris Ryan - Testing
  - Juergen Leising
- Workarounds and fixes for:  
1 "Fatal error: Call to a member function `MoveNext()` on a non-object in
  /var/www/base-127/includes/base_db.inc.php on line 463". Workaround.  
2 Improved error handling in base_action.inc.php: Errors are now shown in
  regular mode rather than with $debug_mode > 1.  Not every kind of error is a
  duplicate error.  
3 Fixed `baseGetHostByAddr()` in base_net.inc.php in cases, where it does not
  get provided with a numerical ("dotted") IP address. The "ERROR: invalid
  input syntax for integer is a rather late state", though.  
4 Fixed a violation of referential integrity, that does not get accepted by
  PostgreSQL, at least not by those ones of version 8.x.  
NOTE: base_action.inc.php, where I have essentially moved the actions around
  the table "event" upwards, so that these lines get performed prior to lines
  that change/update any other tables.
