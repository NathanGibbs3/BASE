# How to contribute to BASE

## Did you find an Issue/Bug?
- Ensure you are running the latest codebase. Sometimes, we have already
fixed the Issue. This can be found in either:
  - The latest release.
  - The latest commit to the
  [master](https://github.com/NathanGibbs3/BASE/tree/master) branch.
  - The latest commit to the
  [devel](https://github.com/NathanGibbs3/BASE/tree/devel) branch, if you
  feel adventurous. :smile:
- **Ensure the Issue was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/NathanGibbs3/BASE/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/NathanGibbs3/BASE/issues/new/choose). Be
sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
information as possible, including the expected and current app behaviors.

## Did you write a patch that fixes an Issue?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you write BASE related code or documentation?
This means code or documentation that may not be suitable for inclusion in
BASE itself; but may be useful to the BASE community.
- Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/NathanGibbs3/BASE).
- Put contributed code in the contrib directory.
- Put contributed documentation in the docs/contrib directory.
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the contributions.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the code and documentation.

Thank you.
